# Dart Payment System Example

This project demonstrates polymorphism and abstraction in Dart using a payment system simulation. It includes multiple payment processors such as M-Pesa, PayPal, and Stripe.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

```
payment_system/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payment_system.dart       # Contains the PaymentProcessor abstract class and implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.dart                 # Runs the application and demonstrates usage
â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml                 # Dart package configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md                    # Project overview (this file)
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the app using Dart:

```bash
dart run bin/main.dart
```

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Abstract class `PaymentProcessor`
- Concrete classes for:
  - `Mpesa`
  - `PayPal`
  - `Stripe`
- Each processor:
  - Validates the payment amount
  - Processes the payment
  - Generates a receipt

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

```
ðŸ’° Processing M-Pesa payment of Ksh 2000.00
ðŸ“„ M-Pesa Receipt: Paid Ksh 2000.00

ðŸ’° Processing PayPal payment of USD 37.50
ðŸ“„ PayPal Receipt: Paid USD 37.50

ðŸ’° Processing Stripe payment of USD 109.00
